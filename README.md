### üéØ Project goal 
---
An American study found that up to 30% of patients missed their appointments and that 150 billion dollars a year was lost due to this. This project aims to analyze the reasons behind missed appointments with data visualizations and identify if any trends are¬†present.<br>

### üîé Overview 
---
The [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)  dataset comprised 110k appointments records from public healthcare institutions in a Brazilian city. 
The appointments occurred across a 6-week period in 2016 (27 days ). 
The appointments occurred from 29.4.2016  to 08.06.2016 . the scheduled visits starts  from 10.11.2015 to 8.6.2016.
The data was derived from 62k patients , from 81 neighborhoods.<br>

**The data consists of the following:**
-	**Identifier**: patient id(non-unique), appointment id ( unique).
-	**Patient information** : gender, the health of the patient (hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handicap), scholarship, receiving SMS.
-	**Appointment information**: schedule date (with the time) and appointment date(without the time).
-	**Location of the clinic** : clinic's neighborhood.
-	**Target**: show or no show ( 0 or 1) 


### Data cleaning:
---
Binary coding for the target 0 = show , 1 = no show , gender 0=male , 1 = female .
Ages under 0 were deleted. There is no null data in the dataset.

### Descriptive Statistics

**Patients by Gender**<br>
![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Lhx45SDsdvBb0h2e1IGezUmvhXCtbzk3)<br>
**Figure 1 :** **A**-(counterclockwise) we can see that 65% of the patients are female (the inner circle), 78% of them (51.8% of the data) show up to the appointments, while 22% of them are absent(13.2% of the overall patients).35% of the patients who make appointments are male, 80% of them show up (28.0% of the patients), while 20% of them are absent (7.0%).<br>
**B-** The distribution of no-shows by age and gender - we can see that in the range 0-10, there is no difference between the rate of no-shows between males and females. However, from the age range of 10-18, the male has more no show, while from the age 18-60, the female has more no show than male.

**C**: Individuals in different age groups exhibit different No-Show behaviors. For example, infants/boys/girls, teenagers, working-age people, and retired populations will all have different No-Show patterns. We can see from this figure that a high rate of females in the age range 20-30 are absent, while there is a high rate of males in the age range of 10-20 who are absent. <br><br>


**Show vs. no show by clinic location**<br>

**Figure 2:** we can see here that there is a high rate of absent patients from some of the neighborhoods like nova Palestina.<br><br>

**Show vs. no show by other categorical features**<br>

**Figure 3:** This figure shows the no show count for each of the other categorical features<br><br>

**Features correlation**

Before machine learning, we must check if there is a correlation between the features. In the figure below, we can see that there is no high correlation between the features. <br>

### Machine learning <br>
#### Model selection and evaluation <br>
This is a binary classification problem, so that I will use the classification models. Features like the scheduled day and appointment day were split into the day of the month, month, and day of the week. Patient id, appointment id, and the neighborhood were dropped (because there are 81 neighborhoods and there will be many features, and it may be cause overfitting).

#### Step 1 : <br>

**The dataset was split into 80 % of the appointments, with a 20% test data set.**<br>


**Figure 11**:<br>
Classification reports for the individual classifiers (with the test set), all the classifiers have approximately the same overall accuracy, precision, and recall.<br>
Using five cross-validation folds, the data was fitted on random forest, logistic regression, KNN, na√Øve Bayes, and tree classification with their default parameter. Then, the models were evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall,f1, and roc AUC score, as shown in figure 11 below.
The test set data performance with random forest results in a recall of 21% for the absent patients, a precision of 40% with an overall accuracy of 78%, and an f1 score of 0.28 for the no-show class. I tried to improve the results in step 2.<br><br>

### Conclusion :

In conclusion, it seems that no-shows can be predicted from patient information and appointment data. More information about the clinic‚Äôs location (e.g., transport accessibility), type of care sought (e.g., primary, specialist), and the patient (e.g., education, income) would likely improve the model. The model could also benefit from a cost-benefit analysis of possible intervention measures to achieve a balance of precision and recall that would make the most business sense.
-	Patients with a high number of previous No-Shows are more likely to No Show in future appointments.
-	 Appointments booked ‚ÄúWithin 24 hours‚Äù are less likely to be No Shows as we can show from figure 7.
-	 Patients in different age groups exhibit different No-Show behaviors, as shown in figure 3 and figure 9.
-	 Longer waiting time, more patients will be absent from the appointments, as we can see from figure 7. So, again, this should be a point to be considered to ameliorate.
-	The neighborhood's location may affect the patients to decide whether they show up for their medical appointments; as shown in figure 6, some neighborhoods have a high rate of absent patients.
-	SMS could be a helpful way to remind patients of their appointments, and we can see that many patients did not receive an SMS, as we can see from figure 8.<br><br>

**Recommendations to improve the attendance:**<br>
-	 sending the SMS notification to every patient who made an appointment.
-	Trying to make the appointment as quickly as possible, limit to less than 15 days.
-	Call the patients who received the SMS and missed up their appointment.

 **Limitation:**<br>
-	We were given only a snapshot of complete data (from one month). Therefore, making exact predictions and analyses on snapshot data is difficult, and the analysis might not represent the actual data.
-	The Time details in the Appointment Day were missing, which would help us predict No Show of a patient.
-	The reason for the appointment and the consultation doctor specialization would have helped us a lot in making better analyses and predictions for the No Show of a patient.
